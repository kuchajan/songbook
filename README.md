# SongBook

A personal project based on a request from my grandfather for a basic application in which he can browse, view and play songs. I also wanted to test out my capabilities with Entity Framework and try out Avalonia.

Although the project is not finished yet, it is runnable and in a usable state.

## TODO:
- New window to implement adding genres to a song and creating them
- A search function in the main window
- Import and export songs and needed metadata to share
